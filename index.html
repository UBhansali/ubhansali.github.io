<h1>Life in a dungeon</h1>

<p>Welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>I am rising senior at UMass Lowell pursuing a Degree in Computer Science. 
I have worked in Visual Studios and Xcode. I am skilled in C, C++, PHP, Xen, KVM, OpenVZ and familiar with MIPS and IA-32.
I have worked at Softaculous for my last Co-op and cofounded steelbuzz.com. 
I have professional experience in Website Development and Wordpress platform plugin development</p>

<p>It lacks images, but at least it has style. 
And it has links, even if it doesn't load.</p>

<p>There should be more here, but I don't know
what yet. Working...</p>
